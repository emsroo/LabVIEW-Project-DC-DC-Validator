#  Hardware in the Loop - Testing and Validation project 
Developers: Yana Zhabura, Emmanuel Rojas

The task is to validate the DUT deviceâ€™s performance which is subjected to a series of test loads. (LM2596), operated from a 9VDC and supplying 3VDC output
There are four resistors,  the device under test load was changed between 1.3 Ohm and 10 Ohm following the test vector sequence.
The following parameters are measured and/or calculated and
validated:
- Input voltage
- Input current
- Input power
- Output voltage
- Output current
- Output power
- Efficiency
